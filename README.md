    <h1>Sirius</h1>
</div>

> Sirius is in a early development stage and may be subject to significant changes, including to its API
> 
> Any features *italicized* are not currently implemented but are planned to be before the full release

Sirius is a cross-platform, comprehensive graphics engine library built using Vulkan 1.3 and designed to be **efficient**, **adaptable**, and **easy to use**.
<br/>

Sirius was developed as a **no-compromises** engine - it gives complete control of a modern and optimized rendering process to the developer while still having a straightforward, easy to use API.
<br/>

It supports windowed and window-less rendering, fully custom compute and graphics shaders, and contains utilities for graphical arithmetic computations. It's written in C++ and it natively supports Windows, Linux, BSD, *Android* and Nintendo Switch 1 & 2.


<h2>Features</h2>

<h3>Design Principles</h3>

- **WYSIWYG** - Anything written by the developer in Sirius is 1:1 with what the graphics API and/or other internal processes execute; There are no under the hood processes that the developer doesn't have control over.
- **[Zero-Overhead](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/Zero-overhead_principle.html)** - You don't pay for what you don't use
- **Bindless** - There are as little pipelines and draw calls as possible; Large buffers for data, Runtime-sized arrays for textures, and no vertex attributes.
- **GPU Driven Rendering** - As little GPU-issued draw calls as possible and no CPU-issued draw calls at all thanks to multi and indirect rendering; The CPU is free for other work and the GPU can do as much work as possible all at once.
- **Extensibility** - The developer and the end-user can extend/customize any built-in functionality

<h3>API</h3>

- *Built-in native modding/plugin API*
- Straightforward and fully customizable initialization process and render timeline declaration
- Developer selectable resource models - complete control over how your resources are used by the GPU
<br/> <br/>
- Familiar API consistent with that of the C++ standard library
- Rich event-based categorized input system
- Complete control over which graphics device to utilize
- Built-in arithmetic types (e.g. vectors, matricies)
- Simple, standardized API for image loading - use the built-in image decoder or create your own decoder that interfaces with a standardized texture API
- Built-in decoding of [ktx2][ktx-software] image files
- Rich result return types on all falliable functions instead of exceptions


<h3>Efficiency</h3>

- Compile-time offloading - almost all rendering branching logic happens at compile time
- No dependence on any platform-specific libraries, SDL, GLM, ImGui, FreeType, ***or even the standard C++ library***.
- Pre-compiled shaders - no shader compilation necessary for the end-user
- Fully asynchronous rendering
- Multithreaded, asynchronous input handling
<br/> <br/>
- No use of exceptions or RTTI - compile with `-fno-exceptions` and `-fno-rtti`
- No use of virtual functions - all polymorphism is static
- Constant number of memory allocations for buffers - 0(1) space complexity thanks to buffer sub-allocation
- Memory-mapped files for I/O
- **Runtime** dispatched SIMD wherever practical


<h3>Documentation</h3>

- *In-depth API documentation formatted similar to that of the standard library*
- *Thorough guides for both high-level and low-level funtionality*
- *Comprehensive examples that showcase a wide range of objectives*


<h2>Showcase</h2>

(Under Construction)


<h2>Example</h2>

A minimal example which opens a window, loads some assets, and renders to the window.

> The `RESULT_XXX` macros verify if the function was successful and proceed with any specified operation if they were. If not, it returns the error code and thus stops execution.

```cpp
#include <sirius.hpp>

int main(){
    //Create an application instance, verifying it was successful
    acma::application<> app;
    RESULT_TRY_MOVE(app, acma::make<acma::application<>>("My App"));


    //Generate a list of graphical devices, verifying the generation was successful and the list is not empty
    std::set<acma::vk::physical_device> device_list;
    RESULT_TRY_COPY(device_list, app.devices());
    if(device_list.empty()) return acma::error::no_vulkan_devices;

    //Select the first device
    app.selected_device() = *device_list.begin();
    
    //Initialize the device, verifying it was successful
    RESULT_VERIFY(app.initialize_device());

    //Create a window, verifying the creation was successful
    acma::window* win;
    RESULT_TRY_COPY(win, app.add_window());


    const std::filesystem::path assets_path = std::filesystem::canonical(std::filesystem::path("../assets"));

    //Add a texture
    win->try_emplace<acma::texture>("characters", assets_path / "my_characters.ktx2");

    //Add a font
    win->try_emplace<acma::font>("main_font", assets_path / "my_font.ttf");

    //Apply the changes, making sure it was successfully applied
    RESULT_VERIFY(win->apply_changes<acma::texture>());
    RESULT_VERIFY(win->apply_changes<acma::font>());


    //Begin async rendering
    std::future<acma::result<void>> render = app.start_async_render();

    //Poll events
    while(app.open())
        app.poll_events();

    //Check the result of the rendering
    RESULT_VERIFY(render.get());

    //Check the result of the rest of the application
    RESULT_VERIFY(app.join());

    return 0;
}
```
<br/>

<details><summary>Alternatively, here's the same example without the result verification macros</summary>

```cpp
#include <sirius.hpp>

int main(){
    //Create an application instance, verifying it was successful
    auto _a = acma::make<acma::application<>>("My App");
    if(!_a.has_value()) return _a.error();
    acma::application<> app = *std::move(a);


    //Generate a list of graphical devices, verifying the generation was successful and the list is not empty
    auto _d = app.devices();
    if(!_d.has_value()) return d.error();
    std::set<acma::vk::physical_device> device_list = *d;
    if(device_list.empty()) return acma::error::no_vulkan_devices;

    //Select the first device
    app.selected_device() = *device_list.begin();
    
    //Initialize the device, verifying it was successful
    auto _i = app.initialize_device();
    if(!_i.has_value()) return _i.error(); 

    //Create a window, verifying the creation was successful
    auto _w = app.add_window();
    if(!_w.has_value()) return w.error();
    acma::window* win = *_w;


    const std::filesystem::path assets_path = std::filesystem::canonical(std::filesystem::path("../assets"));

    //Add a texture
    win->try_emplace<acma::texture>("characters", assets_path / "my_characters.ktx2");

    //Add a font
    win->try_emplace<acma::font>("main_font", assets_path / "my_font.ttf");

    //Apply the changes, making sure it was successfully applied
    if(auto r = win->apply_changes<acma::texture>(); !r.has_value())
        return r.error();
    if(auto r = win->apply_changes<acma::font>(); !r.has_value())
        return r.error();


    //Begin async rendering
    std::future<acma::result<void>> render = app.start_async_render();

    //Poll events
    while(app.open())
        app.poll_events();

    //Check the result of the rendering
    if(auto r = render.get(); !r.has_value())
        return r.error();

    //Check the result of the rest of the application
    if(auto r = app.join(); !r.has_value())
        return r.error();

    return 0;
}

<h3>Compilers</h3>

> This section is only relevant if you are building Sirius from source

Only GCC and Clang (and its derivatives) are officially supported; The MSVC compiler is not supported at all.

The compiler must support gnu-style attributes.

| Compiler | Minimum Version |
